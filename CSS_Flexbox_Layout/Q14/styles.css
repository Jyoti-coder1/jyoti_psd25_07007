/*Identified Problems:
1. flex-wrap: wrap; is allowing the items to wrap and stack — remove it.
2. .links is using flex-direction: column;, which stacks links vertically — change to row.
3. justify-content: center on .navbar is centering everything — instead, space out using space-between.*/
.navbar {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between; /* space between logo and links */
    align-items: center; /* vertically center content */
    background-color: #333;
    padding: 10px 20px;
}

.logo {
    color: white;
    font-size: 24px;
}

.links {
    display: flex;
    gap: 20px; /* evenly space links horizontally */
}

.links a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: white;
    padding: 5px 10px;
}

/*Explanation of Fixes:
justify-content: space-between: pushes the .logo to the left and .links to the right.
align-items: center: keeps both logo and links vertically aligned.
Removed flex-wrap: wrap: prevents items from wrapping and breaking layout.
Changed .links to flex-direction: row: aligns links in a row.
Used gap in .links to keep consistent spacing.*/
