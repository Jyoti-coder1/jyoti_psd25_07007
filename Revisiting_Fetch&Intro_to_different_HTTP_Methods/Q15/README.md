## Comments

- All logic is written in plain JavaScript within the HTML file.
- The application relies on dynamic fetch requests from https://fakestoreapi.com.
- Code includes basic error handling in case the API fetch fails.
- Simple layout without styling, focused purely on logic and data manipulation.
