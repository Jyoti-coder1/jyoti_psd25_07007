## Prompt
Summarize the concept of blockchain, and then simplify it for beginners in a follow-up refinement.

## AI Response
**Step 1 — Summary:**
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger where transactions are securely recorded across multiple computers. Each record (“block”) is linked to the previous one, making it transparent and tamper-proof. It’s widely used in cryptocurrencies and supply chain management.

**Step 2 — Refinement for Beginners:**
Imagine a shared notebook that everyone can see but no one can erase. Each page (block) records transactions permanently. Because everyone has a copy, no single person can cheat. That’s what makes blockchain secure and trustworthy.
